# Real-time Emotion Detection Using OpenCV and DeepFace

This project demonstrates real-time emotion detection from a webcam feed. It uses OpenCV for face detection and DeepFace for emotion analysis.

## Requirements

### 1. **Python** (version 3.x)
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 2. **Required Libraries**

To run this code, the following Python libraries need to be installed:

#### 2.1. **OpenCV** (for computer vision tasks)
- Install using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python

#### 2.2. **DeepFace** (for facial emotion analysis)
- To install the DeepFace library, which is used for facial emotion analysis, run the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install deepface
